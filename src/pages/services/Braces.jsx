            Dental braces are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help to position them with regard to a personâ€™s bite, while also working to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, cross bites, open bites, deep bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw.
